    "### Activity selection problem\n",
    "*Activity selection problem is a problem in which a person has a list of works to do.* \n",
    "\n",
    "*Each of the activities has a starting time and ending time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*We need to schedule the activities in such a way the person can complete a maximum number of activities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Since the timing of the activities  may overlap, so it might not be possible to complete all the activities and thus we need to schedule the activities in such a way that the maximum number of activities can be finished.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can illustrate the problem by drawing each activity as a rectangle whose left\n",
    "and right $x$-coordinates show the start and finish times. The goal is to find a\n",
    "largest subset of rectangles that do not overlap vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](activity.png \"Example\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we’d like the first activity to finish as early as possible,\n",
    "because that leaves us with the most remaining activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this greedy strategy works, it suggests the following very simple\n",
    "algorithm. Scan through the activities in order of finish time; whenever you\n",
    "encounter a activity that doesn’t conflict with your latest activity so far, take it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The above algorithm runs in $\\Theta(n\\log n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that this algorithm actually gives us a maximal conflict-free selection, we use an\n",

    "We are not claiming that the greedy selection is the only maximal selection; there could be others. (See the figures on the.\n",

    "**Lemma** \n",
    "*At least one maximal conflict-free selection includes the activity that finishes first.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $f$ be the activity that finishes first. Suppose we have a maximal conflict-free selection $X$ that does not include $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $g$ be the first activity in $X$ to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since $f$ finishes before $g$ does, $f$ cannot conflict with any activity in the set $X \\setminus \\{g\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, the selection $X' = X \\cup \\{f\\} \\setminus \\{g\\}$ is also conflict-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since $X'$ has the same size as $X$, it is also maximal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use induction to complete the proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma** \n",
    "*The greedy selection is an optimal selection.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $f$ be the activity that finishes first, and let $L$ be the subset of activities the start after $f$ finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The previous lemma implies that some optimal selection contains $f$, so the best selection that contains $f$ is an optimal selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best selection that includes $f$ must contain an optimal selection for the activities that do not conflict with $f$, that is, an optimal selection for $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The greedy algorithm chooses $f$ and then, by the inductive hypothesis, computes an optimal selection of activities from $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a general proof approach** The basic structure of this correctness proof is an inductive exchange argument which applies to several other problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume that there is an optimal solution that is different from the greedy solution.\n",
    "- Find the ``first'' difference between the two solutions.\n",
    "- Argue that we can exchange the optimal choice for the greedy choice without degrading the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This argument implies by induction that some optimal solution that contains the entire greedy\n",
